# Legacy Emacs Configuration

This directory contains legacy configuration files that have been archived during the modernization process.
They are kept here for reference or fallback purposes.

- `init-language-rust.el`: Old Rust configuration using `rustic` and `lsp-mode`. Replaced by `init-language-rust-ts.el` using `rust-ts-mode` and `eglot`.
- `ra-emacs-lsp.el`: Custom Rust Analyzer LSP bridge. Deprecated.
